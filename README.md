# Ferentu, Blockchain in Go

A minimal blockchain implementation in Go, built for learning and experimentation.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple blockchain implementation written in Go. It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology:
- **Blocks** with data, timestamps, and hashes.
- **Chaining** blocks using cryptographic hashes.
- **Immutability** and tamper detection.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Create a blockchain with a genesis block.
- Add new blocks to the chain.
- Validate the integrity of the blockchain.
- Basic proof-of-work (mining) simulation.
